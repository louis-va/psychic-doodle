# Psychic Doodle

Psychic Doodle is a web browser game where players draw in the air using hand gestures recognized by their device's camera. One player creates a sketch without touching the screen, and the drawing appears in real-time for everyone to see. Other players watch and try to guess what's being drawn. It's a touchless, interactive twist on classic drawing and guessing games!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
